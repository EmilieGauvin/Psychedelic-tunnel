# Psychedelic tunnel

This line tunnel randomly morphs at its own rhythm. Move your mouse around to play with its evolving shape. 
The tunnel illusion is created by a succession of simple planes with each a cloned custom shader material generating the sinusoidal animation. Each clone has a time increment that delays the animation and creates the hypnotic tunnel effect.
Built in Three.js, React
